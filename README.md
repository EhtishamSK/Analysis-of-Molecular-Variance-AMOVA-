# AMOVA Analysis Script
This R script performs an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) on SNP data. It imports SNP data, aligns individual IDs with population assignments, and runs AMOVA using the `poppr` package.

## Usage
- Set the working directory to your project folder.
- Ensure `GWAS128.str` and `population.csv` are in the directory.
- Install required packages and run the script.

## Requirements
- R with `adegenet`, `poppr`, and `ape` packages.
